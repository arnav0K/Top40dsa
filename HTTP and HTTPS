TTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring data over the internet. 
It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between a client (like a web browser) and a server. 
HTTP is used for non-secure communication, meaning data sent between the client and server is not encrypted.

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP that adds security by encrypting the data exchanged between the client and server using SSL/TLS protocols. 
This ensures that sensitive information, like passwords or credit card details, is protected from eavesdropping or tampering.

Key Differences:
HTTP: Unsecured, no encryption.
HTTPS: Secured, encrypted data transfer.
