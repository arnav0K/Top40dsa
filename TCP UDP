The internet is like a giant web of connected computers and devices all around the world. Imagine it as a huge network of highways, where each computer or phone is a car. These cars can travel on these highways to send and receive information, like emails, pictures, or even videos, between different places.

When you use the internet, you're simply sending or receiving information through this web of connections. Whether you're browsing a website, chatting with someone, or watching a video, the internet helps deliver that content from one place to another, super fast!

In simpler terms, the internet is like a digital postal service that delivers messages and information across the globe instantly. 



The internet is a global network of connected devices that communicate using protocols like TCP/IP.
It allows devices (like computers and smartphones) to exchange data, such as browsing websites, sending emails, and streaming videos. 
The internet uses IP addresses to identify devices, and DNS to translate domain names into IP addresses.
It enables services like web browsing, file sharing, and communication, with data routed through various routers and servers across the globe.
